# PROJECT 1
 

Reflection:

The process of Project 1 Responsive Website for Front-End Web Design encountered many new challenges and pleasing experiences when developing new design skills within the Web Design sector. With this unit being an elective and HTML and CSS practices being newly revisited since my first year, I believe this project assisted me to step outside of my comfort zone and try something new.

The visit from Canberra Modern's heritage and design practitioners, Edwina Jans and Rachel Jackson was greatly appreciated and beneficial towards the development of this project, displaying their passion for Canberra Modern and communicating their strive for history and community advocacy. Their visit assisted in the understanding of the desires they would like to promote on the site and the encouragement of audience engagement and event-based advocacy. They illuminated the importance of acknowledging many stories about Canberra with the website being informative of Canberra’s architecture and history.

I desired to continue to promote these significant aspects of protecting the nature of Canberra's history and connecting to those passionate about the history of Canberra's architecture, as well as those who wish to advocate to protect Canberra's meaningful history. Throughout the development of this project, my strength lies within the main design intentions for the website, regarding decisions of legible type, colours aligning with Canberra Modern's logo and layout to connect to the target audience, and all elements aligning to the provided brand guidelines. Their motto “Conservation through participation” is highlighted on the home page, with the remaining sector of the website including an about, events and gallery page to present the dedicated work and passion of those involved within Canberra Modern and participate with just as much passion. The minimalistic site is designed to ensure the legibility of type and white space created by containers to create a calm user experience as I desired to celebrate the spirit of Canberra’s history and development of modern architecture and minimise overwhelming content.

During the development of this project, certain challenges arose regarding the correct and efficient use of HTML and CSS assets. While beginning this project, I believe I approached the site with a design vision, however, was uncertain how to successfully execute my concept. I believe more research and development of understanding towards HTML and CSS before beginning the project would have been significantly beneficial to assist in simplifying the use of classes and CSS tags and creating a more dynamic designed site. Furthermore, the uncertainty of implementations of HTML was a challenge as my lack of understanding towards the correct use of tags to successfully execute my design concept became an area for improvement, however, with further development and practice I grasped a more secure understanding of the most appropriate ways to approach the project in regard to both HTML and CSS elements. To solve the issues faced throughout this project, I utilised code sources including W3Schools for the guidance of HTML and CSS possibilities, as well as significant assistance from fellow peers and teachers to improve the user experience of the site and coding challenges.

I have learnt many new techniques and concepts regarding web design from the development of this project including parallax scroll, grid and flex implementations, rows and columns, and media queries to create a functional, responsive site. In hindsight, I would do more research in the ideation phase of this design process and gain a more secure grasp of the uses of html and CSS tags. Furthermore, deeper depth and development of low-fidelity sketches would be beneficial for approaching this project to ensure I stay on track when designing and researching resources and inspirational website design that could influence and improve the overall creative direction of the final output of the site.



Low-fi prototypes

Low-Fi sketches were developed prior to the development of the website and began the ideation process. Most layout ideas were utilised in the final site, with consistency with rows, columns, and utilisation of hero images. However, when approaching the project, the hamburger menu was not implemented as I was unsure how to execute the idea, and inner pages were also not implemented as displayed on the event page low-fi sketch. However, the consistency of grids and even column and row designs throughout the event and gallery pages were successfully implemented.

High-fi

Home page ideation utilising Figma, with most of the layout implemented into the final design, including the nav bar, hero image, buttons and parallax scroll effect. The development of the high-fi sketches influenced by the low-fi sketches provided insight of a successful layout for the home page design.
