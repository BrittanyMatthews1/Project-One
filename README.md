# PROJECT 1
 

reflection:

The process of project 1 Responsive Website for Front-End Web Design encounted many new challenges and pleasing experiences when developing new design skills within the Web Design sector. With this unit being an elective and HTML and CSS practices being newly revisted since my first-year, I believe this project assisted me to step outside of my confort zone and try something new.

The visit from Canberra Modern's heritage and design practitioners, Edwina Jans and Rachel Jackson, was greatly appreciated and benefitial towards the development of this projects, displaying their passion for Canberra Modern and communicating their strive for history and community advocacy. Their visit assisted in the understanding of their desires they would like to promote on the site and the encouragement of audience engagement and event-based advocacy. They illuminated the importance of acknowledging many stories about Canberra with the website being informative of Canberra’s architecture and history.

I desired to continue to promote these significant aspects of protecting the nature of Canberra's history and connecting to those those passionate about the history of Canberra's architecture, as well as those who wish to advocate to protect Canberra's meaningful history. Throughout the devleopment of this project, my strength lies within the main design intentions for the website, regarding decisions of legible type, colours aligning with Canberra Modern's logo and layout to connect to the target audience, all elements aligning to the provided brand guidelines. Their motto “Conservation through participation” is highlighting in the home page, with the remaining sector of the website including an about, events and gallery page to present the dedicated work and passion of those involved within Canberra Modern, and participates with just as much passion. The minimalistic site is designed to ensure legibility of type and white space created by containers to create a calm user experience as I desired to celebrate the celebrate the spirit of Canberra’s history and development of modern architecture and minimise overwhelming content.

During the development of this project, certain challenges arose regarding correct and efficient uses of HTML and CSS assests. While beginning this project, I believe I approached the site with a design vision, however, was uncertain how to successfully execute my concept. I believe more research and development of understanding towards HTML and CSS before beginning the project would have been significantly benefictial to assist in simplyifing the use of classes and css tags and create a more dynamic designed site. Furthermore, the uncertainty of implementations of HTML were a challenge as my lack of understanding towards the correct use of tags to successfully execute my design concept became an area for improvement, however, with further development and practice I grasped a more secure understanding of the most appropriate ways to approach the project in regards to both HTML and CSS elements. To solve the issues faced throuhgout this project, I utilised code sources including W3Schools for guidance of HTML and CSS possibilities, as well as significant assistance from fellow peers and teachers to improve the userexperience of the site and coding challanges.

I have learnt many new techniques and concepts regarding web design from the development of this project including parallax scroll, grid and flex implimentations, rows and columns, and media queires to create a functional, responsive site. In hindsight, I would do more research in the indiation phase of this design process and gain a more secure grasp onto uses of html and css tags. Furthermore, deeper depth and development of low-fidelity sketches would be benefictial for approaching this project to ensure I stay on track when designing and research resources and inspirational website design that could influence and improve the overall creative direction of the final output of the site.

provide a briefly annotated list of resources that you found helpful while creating the website. 


In the reflection, you might describe the reasons for any design decisions you made, or discuss a description of the challenges you encountered and how you solved them. It is your chance to reflect on the project and consider what you learnt or what would you would do differently.
